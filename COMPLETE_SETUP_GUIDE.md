## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Blog Content Spacing - FIXED! ✅**

**Problem:** Blog posts had no spacing between paragraphs and headings - everything ran together

**Solution:** 
- Installed markdown-to-HTML converter
- Added proper spacing to all blog elements:
  - Headings now have 10px top margin and 5-6px bottom margin
  - Paragraphs have 6px bottom margin
  - Lists have proper spacing between items
  - All content is now properly formatted with breathing room

**Test it yourself:** Visit any blog post (like `/blog/25`) and scroll down - you'll see proper spacing between all sections!
