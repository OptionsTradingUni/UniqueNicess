## Is the Site "Trustworthy Enough"?

### For TikTok Traffic → Telegram Conversion: **YES!** ✅

**Why it's enough:**
1. **TikTok visitors are warm leads** - They already saw your content and clicked bio
2. **Low commitment ask** - Just "message on Telegram" (not buying yet)
3. **Social proof is strong** - 100 varied testimonials is MORE than most competitors
4. **Professional appearance** - Looks like a real business, not a scam

**Conversion expectation:**
- Good site: 5-10% click Telegram link
- Great site: 10-20% click Telegram link
- Your site: Should hit **10-15%** range (good positioning)

### For Cold Traffic (Google Ads, etc.): **NEEDS MORE** ⚠️

Cold traffic needs more credibility:
- About page with founder story
- Video testimonials
- Press mentions or social proof
- Longer-form educational content

**But you're not doing cold traffic, so this doesn't matter!**
