There are still many issues 

1. Sarah made the name was repotted continuously so many times and profits made 
2. ⁠also the calls and puts too same thing also let it be real like related to market even tho 
3. ⁠ the videos in library all I can see is cartoon characters, you can take it from YouTube if possible can I even if I’m not the owner of the video and the video won’t redirect them it will play automatically and in some video sessions that you think it’s important lock it and say until after payment can they get access to it something like that , 0123 will be the password to unlock 
4. ⁠in testimonials what our members say there can be like 10 there while. In more members feedback you can make it 20 so only the one in 10 will contain pictures of face and profit screenshots 
Also how do I upload or put the profits there 
While the rest down some will have pictures some won’t 
Or is Renee a way to include an admin dashboard for myself to do all this edits , it will contain all and every edits 
And also contain insights etc 
Also in that admin dashboard it will contain things I can use to improve posts I post on my website 
Like this 
Also how do I access the admin dashboard that other members won’t know about ? On the web so I enter and view but others won’t know 

This is the prompt 

Generate a viral TikTok caption for a finance or trading post (profit screenshot, member message, setup breakdown, or motivational update).
Make it sound authentic, confident, and human — like a real trader posting in real time. Avoid ad-like tone or robotic patterns.

Your output should include both:
	•	Title line (on-screen text / video headline)
	•	Caption body (200–309 words, TikTok-optimized)

Follow all rules below carefully 👇

⸻

🎯 STYLE & STRUCTURE
	•	Randomly vary tone between motivational, analytical, conversational, or storytelling styles.
	•	You may write from first-person (“I caught…”) or community perspective (“We caught…”) to keep it fresh.
	•	Occasionally reference member wins, small profits, or emotional lessons to increase relatability.
	•	Mix long sentences with short punchlines to sound human.
	•	Avoid identical phrasing across posts — paraphrase lessons each time.

Format (flexible — do not always use in same order):
1️⃣ Hook: curiosity-driven or emotional.
2️⃣ Mini-story: how the trade/setup/member win unfolded.
3️⃣ Mindset/Lesson: what it taught (discipline, risk, patience, consistency).
4️⃣ FOMO trigger: remind viewers of opportunity or consistency.
5️⃣ CTA: soft, natural (e.g., “Follow for more clean setups,” “Comment ‘learn’ if you want the breakdown”).

HASHTAG ROTATION SYSTEM
Auto-select one set per caption depending on tone:

🔹 Set A — Profit / Discovery (Viral Reach)
#stockmarket #stocks #finance #daytrading #fyp #usmarkets #investing

🔹 Set B — Trader / Skill (Authority)
#optionstrading #investing #daytrader #tradingtips #spx #nasdaq

🔹 Set C — Mindset / Lifestyle (Emotional)
#motivation #optionstrading #tradingcommunity #financialfreedom #wealthmindset #usfinance

🔹 Set D — Hybrid / Safe Anytime (Balanced)
#stockmarket #finance #trading #investing #daytrading #usmarkets

Use only 5 hashtags per caption and rotate wording automatically (e.g., swap “#stockmarket” for “#usmarkets”).

Caption Input Example:
Caption: “SPX keeps going 40k. Profit: $40,950.”

🧩 Add “Member Report” & “Community Proof” Post Styles

You can mix screenshots or messages into posts like these — they feel real, build trust, and show teamwork instead of bragging.

Examples (ready-to-use prompts inside your AI):

Member Win Style:

Caption: “Member flipped $190 → $1,240 today on $TSLA 🔥”

Group Update Style:

Caption: “Community caught the $SPX reversal this morning — 3 clean plays, all green 📈”

Mini-Report Style:

Caption: “Recap of the week: 8 trades shared, 6 winners, 2 cut early. Patience really paid this week 🙏”

Emotional Win Style:

Caption: “One of our newest traders made $180 today. Sounds small? That was his first ever green day after months of losses. That’s the win that matters most.”
