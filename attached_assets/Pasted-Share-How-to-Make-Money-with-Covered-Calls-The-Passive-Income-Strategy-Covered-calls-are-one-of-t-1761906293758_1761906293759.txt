# How to Make Money with Covered Calls: The Passive Income Strategy Covered calls are one of the most popular options strategies for generating passive income. If you own stocks and want to earn extra money from them every month, this strategy is perfect for you. ## What is a Covered Call? A covered call involves two positions: 1. You own 100 shares of a stock 2. You sell 1 call option against those shares By selling the call, you collect premium income immediately. In exchange, you agree to potentially sell your shares at the strike price if the stock rises above it. ## How Covered Calls Generate Income When you sell a call option, the buyer pays you a premium. This premium is yours to keep regardless of what happens. For example: - You own 100 shares of AAPL at $175 - You sell a $180 call expiring in 30 days for $2.50 - You immediately collect $250 ($2.50 x 100 shares) ## The Three Possible Outcomes **Scenario 1: Stock stays below strike price** - You keep your shares AND the premium - Option expires worthless - You can sell another call next month **Scenario 2: Stock rises above strike price** - Your shares get called away at the strike - You keep the premium - You made money on both the stock gain and the premium **Scenario 3: Stock drops significantly** - You keep your shares and premium - The premium partially offsets the stock loss - You can average down or hold for recovery ## Selecting the Right Stocks Best stocks for covered calls: - **Blue-chip dividend payers** (steady with income) - **Low to moderate volatility** (more predictable) - **Stocks you don't mind selling** (at your target price) - **High liquidity** (tight bid-ask spreads) Examples: AAPL, MSFT, JPM, KO, WMT ## Choosing Strike Prices and Expirations **Strike Price Selection:** - **Conservative:** 5-10% out-of-the-money (lower premium, lower risk of assignment) - **Moderate:** 2-5% out-of-the-money (balanced approach) - **Aggressive:** At-the-money or in-the-money (higher premium, higher assignment risk) **Expiration Selection:** - **Weekly:** More frequent income, more active management - **Monthly:** Standard approach, good premium/time balance - **45-60 days:** Maximize theta decay (time value erosion) ## Real Example: Monthly Income Strategy Portfolio: $50,000 in stocks - 200 shares AAPL @ $175 = $35,000 - 300 shares MSFT @ $50 = $15,000 Monthly covered calls: - Sell 2 AAPL $180 calls @ $2.50 = $500 - Sell 3 MSFT $52 calls @ $1.00 = $300 - **Total monthly income: $800** - **Annualized return: 19.2%** ## Managing Covered Calls **If stock approaches strike:** - Let it get called away and take profits - Roll the option up and out for more premium - Buy back the option and sell shares manually **If stock drops:** - Hold and collect premium - Average down with more shares - Sell put options to buy more shares at a discount ## Tax Considerations - Premium income is taxed as short-term capital gains - If shares are called away, it's a stock sale (short or long-term depending on holding period) - Consult with a tax professional for your specific situation ## Pros and Cons **Pros:** - Generate income from stocks you already own - Reduces cost basis over time - Works in sideways or slightly bullish markets - Relatively low risk strategy **Cons:** - Caps upside potential - Stocks can still decline in value - Time-intensive if managing many positions - May trigger taxable events ## Getting Started Checklist 1. ✅ Own at least 100 shares of quality stocks 2. ✅ Understand assignment risk 3. ✅ Calculate your target monthly income 4. ✅ Select appropriate strike prices 5. ✅ Start with 1-2 positions to gain experience 6. ✅ Track performance and adjust strategy ## Advanced Tips - **Sell on high IV days** to maximize premium - **Use 30-45 DTE** for optimal theta decay - **Target 1-2% monthly return** per position - **Diversify across sectors** to reduce risk - **Keep some buying power** for opportunities Covered calls are an excellent strategy for investors who want to generate consistent income from their stock portfolio. Start small, master the mechanics, and gradually scale up as you gain confidence.
